    <p>It begins with a miss.

        The yellow digits of the Moda Center's game clock blink down to 1:10 remaining in the first quarter as Portland center Zach Collins' corner 3 clanks violently off the glass. It floats softly above the rim, then down into the outstretched hands of Golden State's Kevon Looney. The Warriors center hands it to Shaun Livingston, who takes one dribble, then shuffles it to Curry, who, according to Second Spectrum tracking data, takes the first step on this 226-foot journey.</p>

       <p>Curry approaches midcourt with the ball and immediately falls victim to his own reputation. Over the past eight seasons Curry has, almost single-handedly, radically altered the geometry of the half-court offense. His range and accuracy have weaponized an area of the court 10 feet beyond the 3-point line that used to be largely dormant. Curry's shooting has been so otherworldly for so long, in fact -- he has led the league in 3s five times and is third among active players with a .434 shooting percentage -- that even hoops historians have to reference other sports to find a suitable comparison.</p>

    <div class="col-md-3">
    <p>"Curry has the same effect as Lawrence Taylor," says David Thorpe, a TrueHoop.com analyst and executive director of the Pro Training Center in Clearwater, Florida. "You always had to account for LT [a New York Giants Hall of Fame linebacker], and it made people paranoid and wore teams down mentally and you could use that fear to free up other defenders because people were so scared of leaving LT alone. Curry has that same effect. It was everyone's job to make sure LT didn't break your quarterback's leg in half. With Curry, it's everyone's job to make sure he doesn't break your back with his shot."</p>

      <p>As Curry trots toward the top of the Moda Center court logo, still some 37 feet from the basket, five sets of eyes are glued on him. Three Portland defenders, including his younger brother, Seth, are above the arc and ready to engage. After more than a decade in the league, there are few freebies for Steph, even at 35 feet. On most trips up the court, and especially now with Klay Thompson still hurt and Kevin Durant long gone, this is the challenge that awaits Curry in the later part of his career: If he wants space to shoot, he has to carve it out by himself with his legs and his wits.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-2">
      <p>"Steph tests you in so many ways beyond just his shooting," says veteran NBA coach and ESPN analyst P.J. Carlesimo. "He is one of the best in the league moving without the ball. It doesn't get as much attention, but with his quickness and conditioning, Steph will run you to death. It's about the biggest nightmare you can have in this league. I mean, as a defense you've got to be thinking, 'Jesus, how many problems can we have trying to guard one guy on one possession?'".</p>

      <p>Curry has been quietly working on this part of his game for nearly a decade. During the 2011 NBA lockout, he was home in Charlotte, where he joined former Hornets player Gerald Henderson for a unique workout -- no frills, but cutting-edge -- at Accelerate Basketball with trainer Brandon Payne, who specializes in neurocognitive efficiency.</p>

      <p>They've been working together ever since. And they remain close enough to this day that, on mornings after big games or tough losses, you're likely to hear Payne on the phone chatting with Curry from his cramped, messy headquarters in an old metal-framed warehouse south of Charlotte. "I have a tough job," Payne says. "I have to tell the greatest shooter who ever lived, over and over, 'It's not good enough.'</p>

      <p>Because Curry's pregame shooting routine is done in public and so widely known, most people assume that his offseason workouts are similar. The viral pregame routine, however, is not a workout. It's a kinetic activation process, like batting practice in baseball or hitting the range before a round of golf. The truth is, in his private offseason workouts with Payne, Curry rarely takes more than a handful of shots from the same spot and never runs traditional draconian hoops-conditioning drills such as wind sprints or gassers. Instead, he combines the two.</p>

      <p>Last offseason, when Curry did this workout at Stanford, several Division I players in attendance begged to join in on Payne's ultimate scoring-without-the-ball drill -- they all either collapsed from exhaustion or gave up halfway through. That's exactly what Payne expects, though, since the drill is designed specifically to challenge Curry's remarkable conditioning and unique skill set in order to prepare him for challenges like the one against Portland.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">

      <p>"Steph's definition of conditioning is different than most," Payne says. "Lots of guys are in great shape. Can you be in the kind of great shape where you are fatigued after a long play like this and your quads are burning and you can't breathe but you can still maintain perfect mechanics and still make good decisions? Are you fatigued but can still execute at the highest levels? Because that's what truly matters."</p>
